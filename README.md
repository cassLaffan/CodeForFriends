Code With Bugfixes for Friends

This is a repository for my friends to pull and push to as they wish. Here we can learn from each other in any 
and all programming languages of our choosing. Hopefully through this repository, a greater appreciation for 
collaboration and commenting your code in a meaningful way that actually makes sense will be developed.

Comment your code.

Please.
